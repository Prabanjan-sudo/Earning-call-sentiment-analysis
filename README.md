# Earning-call-sentiment-analysis

An earnings call is a teleconference, or webcast, in which a public company discusses the financial results of a reporting period

Sentiment analysis of earnings calls draws upon disparate disciplines ranging from decision making, management, finance, accounting, psychology, linguistics, and data science to derive conclusions on the optimal attribution techniques employed by individuals when publicly speaking 

Earning calls have emerged as a prominent source of information for researchers. Researchers have also found that the qualitative information such as the tone of voice used by the executives and level of optimistic language employed are stronger predictors of a firm’s performance 

In sentiment analysis we will calculate polarity and subjectivity.
Polarity lies between [-1,1], -1 defines a negative sentiment and 1 defines a positive sentiment. Negation words reverse the polarity. TextBlob has semantic labels that help with fine-grained analysis. For example — emoticons, exclamation mark, emojis, etc. Subjectivity lies between [0,1]. Subjectivity quantifies the amount of personal opinion and factual information contained in the text. The higher subjectivity means that the text contains personal opinion rather than factual information
